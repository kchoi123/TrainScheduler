## Main Pointers:
### Using Google Firebase
### Using Moment JS for TIME

#### Because data is being stored on a cloud databse, Google Firebase, users can see history that is being pulled from the cloud database. Users can continue to add more train routes but only administrators access to the Firebase can edit or delete changes.
